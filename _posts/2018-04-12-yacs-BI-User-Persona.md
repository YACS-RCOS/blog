Course registration is already painful for us. It is even more challenging more our advisors. Lately, we've been reaching out the professors, advisors, and students on campus to do a survey about what kind of feature are they expecting from BI. And here is some thoughts I have on that.
They have to first consider all of the potential conflicts since many students are doing some weird dual majors so they have to figure out how to avoid these conflicts. 

Also they have to worry about how many students are going to sign up for a specific section for its timing or location. Some sections fills up too quickly due to its good timing.

Most importantly, they have to balance the task of professors and decide who is teaching the course. Some professorsâ€™ classes do not have enough students while some professors have overwhelmingly amount of students sign up for their course.

Professors are also using sis and they are having their challenges too. For example, if too many students are signing up for a specific course. The professor then need to think about opening a new section. Or making a larger section. Remember when we sign up for this HCI course. Many of us had problem taking this course since they were only 20 seats at the beginning.

On the other hand, professors are also concerning about students dropping out of their classes. Specially large section, it is basically impossible to tell who got out of the class and how many percent of students decided to leave. Making them hard to improve their teaching style.

Students. I believe we all had some challenges registering for courses. Especially in the freshmen year. I remember when I was scheduling for my first semester, I had to manually think about the courses available and fit them into my schedule. It was a nightmare. 

Also, we have no idea what the class is going to talk about. From sis, we only know the title of the course which is most likely abstract. I still have no idea what differential equations are although i am taking that course next year. And I cannot remember the professor name of that class. 

We learn so little about the professors for upcoming courses. Sometimes we want a harder professor so we can learn more in the course. Sometimes we want an easier professor so we can get an easy A without too much hard work. However SIS does not help us determine which professors class we should sign up for.


Go Yacs.
