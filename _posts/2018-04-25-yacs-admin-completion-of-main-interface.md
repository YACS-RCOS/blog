I just finished adding a simple list to display the available periods for each section. Now, I think we can say our main interface is fully implemented and we met our milestone. Users can access the list and details of each component and even though the front end isn't the prettiest, the main framework is done. Next steps from here could be to make the front end look better. There are still some formatting errors in css but that shouldn't be too difficult.
