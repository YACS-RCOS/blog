We as a group spent the first couple weeks of the semester trying to use the local setup. Then I decided to pick Bayes' Theorem as my first topic for this semester because I had some experience with the
Bayes' rule when I was in FOCS and I think I should be able to look deeper into it.
The books are listed below:
1. Think Bayes
2. Bayes' Rule: A Tutorial Introduction to Bayesian Analysis

The issues so far:

	*Relate the theorem to the actual data analysis process
	*Summarize the main points and examples in the books

My major goals are:

- Study Bayes' Theorem and make notes on how we can possibly use it

- Work with other students in my group in order to implement the algorithms I learned

- Get to know more recommendation algorithms

I read through the first half of Think Bayes and although I got to know more about the usage of the Bayes' Theorem, I found it hard to apply it in the actual data analysis that the other students in my
group were doing because most of the codes were provided and I was simply selecting the correct function and putting in the data. Then I switched to a more theory-based book and hoped that I could really
learn something from it and eventually be able to apply this knowledge.
We did our presentation last Friday and one fellow student suggested that we should find more algorithms in order to provide a more accurate recommendation system for students and I think that's a great 
idea because it allows me to familiarize myself with more interesting algorithms and make actual contribution to the team.
