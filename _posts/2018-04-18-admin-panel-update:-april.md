This semester, I anticipated to complete 3 milestones: Completion of Main Interface, Search, and Pagination. As I mentioned in my last blog post, I severely underestimated how busy this semester would be, so it looks like we may only complete the first milestone this semester.

I thought that I would only be incredibly busy at the end of February and the beginning of March (when both of us took a 2-week hiatus), but the workload has not stopped despite not having four exams in one week again. 

That being said, I really should have broken down the first milestone into submilestones, that way we could see how much progress we are actually making.

Out of sheer boredom, I also added a staging build option, which allows a local instance of YACS to be used instead of a test database or the live instance of YACS. This will be ultimately useful as we test and expand our product, and will help bridge the gap between the admin team and the rest of the YACS team with regards to knowledge of the main YACS product. 

This option was not planned for in the Completion of Main Interface milestone, but is a huge help towards future builds, so I can consider this a submilestone.
