Hello Everyone!

Since the start of this project, one of our most important goals has been to spread YACS to other schools. There is a lot that needs to go into making that happen, and we have been working towards this for quite a while. This work can be divided into two categories: building out the tech, and building our community. Both of these things, done well, will help to ensure the longevity of the project as the existing core contributors eventually leave RPI and may have less capacity to contribute. I'd like to drill down into this a little more, and give some details as to where we are.

## Technical
The biggest technical challenges of getting YACS into other schools present themselves when trying to come up a robust way to model and process academic data.

The problem with how we model data is that until we really work with existing systems at many other schools, it is hard to predict how and where we need to generalize our model.

This problem is intertwined with the issue of processing data. This is because most schools have many different sources of data that we should leverage to provide the best experience. A school will often use one service for hosting their catalog, one for managing registrations, another for managing curriculum, and so on.

## Community
The greatest benefit of expanding to outher schools is the opportunity to build a strong and diverse community around the project. This expansion will not only allow us improve our project, but ensure it stands the test of time.
