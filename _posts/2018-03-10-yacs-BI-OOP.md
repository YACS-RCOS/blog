Hi guys, this is a post from YACS BI team. With all concerns I have at the begining of the semester, we actually get to finsh the OOP implementation before the date we thought it would be. This milestone is actually of great importance to our project.

The reason we come up with OOP(Object Oriented Programming) is it is easier for people from non-CS backgroud to have an easier way to do data analysis by simply called methods from object. For example, oneSemesterObject.departments will return all departments in that semester. And accordingly, oneDepartmentObject.courses will return all courses for this department. In that case, not only are data orderd time-seriesly, but also it semantically makes more sense for data analyst to analyze the data with some methodology proved in discrete math already.


With the help of the OOP, we did some funny experiments. For example, we have a list of professors ranked by the course seat taken rate. With that list, we can bascially tell who is the most popular professor at RPI. According to all records we have in our database, it is Dr.Barm from cognitive science department, and luckly, he is a very nice professor according to some of his studetns.

I can't wait to see more results!

Go Yacs.
