I am new to RCOS and the YACS team.

I will be working on helping to expand the capabilities of YACS updates outside of just the background team of developers. I hope to gain a lot of experience with web development and git, along with gaining valuble team and project experience for the future.

My current experience includes:

Coding:

	*HTML/PHP
	*Python
	*C/C++

General:

	*RPI administrative knowledge
	*Basic front-end development

I am excited to see what this semester brings!
