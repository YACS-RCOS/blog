Hi everyone, my name is Bryan Dieudonne, and I will be joining YACS this summer to work on multiple components of the YACS system. As of today, Iâ€™m learning Ruby/Rails,Kafka, and the codebase. I plan to work on the following parts of the YACS ecosystem:

- Hamilton (yacs-hamilton)
- Users Service (yacs-users)

This list is subject to change & check out for my blog updates accordingly.
