At the begining of this semester, I had a long conversation with Ada about dividing the yacs development team into multiple sub teams, they are:

- Admin Pannel team

- Core Frontend team

- Backend Kafka team

- Data Analysis team

- (Still thinking about it)Business Development team

I'm actually we could divide a huge dev team into this way, because in that case developers can focus more on what they are doing compared with facing multiple tasks. To me, due to the working experience about data analysis, I transfered from backend team into data analysis team.

With time passed by, we gradually helped new developers get uesd to those stacks they've never seen before. I would like to list several problems we met during the process of helping new members get into the development:

- Windows User : To be fair, Windows is a great operating system for normal users. However, it is not developer-friendly. There are a lot of features lacking for older version windows, and sometimes it is very likely a new technique dosn't support multiple windows versions. For example, it is very hard to setup docker and command line prompt on any windows version before 10. And even for winodws 10, we still need pro version to do so.

- Unfamiliar with Git : It is quite essential for not only software developers but also people who are involved with team work. I do believe having the idea of version control and team collaboration is of great help to a job/project. To be fair, it is very easy to pick up some basic git commands such as git pull, git clone, and git commit. However, git is never taught officially at RPI any course below 2000 level, and very rarely mentioned in the 4000 level courses, which is kind of hard to push the work forward.(We may not need to dive in that deep.) 

- Unfamiliar with teamwork : It happens a lot at a tech like RPI. Everyone is genius, and geniuses are not tend to work well with each other. We all have different ways for solving problems, and I truly believe that all roads will lead us to Roam. This is something we are looking forward to solving.

However, there are also something new I figured after we have new members on board:

- New thoughts about solving the problem.

- Proven of some methodology I had in my mind for a while.

- New blood in the team, which is very exciting, and we are all looking forward to bringing more feature for YACS.

Go Yacs.
