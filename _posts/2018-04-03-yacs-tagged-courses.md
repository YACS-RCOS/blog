As the last month of the semster rolls around, I have completed a milestone. 

There is now a feature in the YACS database to tag a course. Specifically for this issue, a course can be tagged as "featured" to indicate the course as a Special Topics Course. 

This update is accompanied by a beta front-end button called Topics which will specifically display Special Topics Courses.

Having finished this issue, I am now familiar with both the YACS back-end structure along with writing basic tests for the database. 

I hope to continue my progress and finish at least one more issue by the end of the semester and possibly figure out how I will be ablew to continue my project contributions next semester.
