After taking the beginning of the semster to learn git, Angular, the yacs development enviroment, and the various languages I need (Ruby, TypeScript, CSS) I had a pretty successful semester.

I implemented the following major updates:

	*Class location display on schedule view
	*Consolidation of disjoint site models to one location
	*System for tagging courses for various uses
	*Display of courses with "featured" tag for display of topics courses
	*Fixes of various bugs such as incorrect schedule color dislay and date labels

Overall, I feel I was succesful in achieving my goals this semester. I learned to use git and got very thorough experience as I made errors and had to correct them.

While I am not able to enroll in RCOS for the coming semster, I plan to continue to contribute to YACS and hopefully return in the spring.
