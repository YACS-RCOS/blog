I've been thinking about how to apply the research to the analysis process and I think based on the amount of data we have now we can start to consider using machine learning to provide
recommendations.
The reference book:
Programming Collective Intelligence

My current tasks:

- Learn how collaborative filtering works

- Work with other students in my group in order to implement the algorithms I learned

Since we have a relatively large data set I think it's appropriate to apply the machine learning methods and train a model that recognizes patterns based on what we have.
There are limitations to machine learning so we need to target specific areas and problems that we want to solve.
What we develop now should continue to grow and should be able to help future students work on this project.
Two systems for calculating similarity scores:

- Euclidean distance

- Pearson correlation
