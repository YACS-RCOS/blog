Hello folks,

This has been a long time coming, and we are super excited to announce that YACS
is going to NYU!

We will provide more details in the coming weeks, but in short we are working
with a great group of folks at NYU's BUGS Computer Science club to bring YACS
to the Brooklyn campus, and eventually to the entire university.

We've created a [new repository](https://github.com/YACS-RCOS/university) to
manage the development and communication of all things NYU, and after that,
hopefully many more universities! The full proposal for the NYU collaboration
initiative can be viewed
[here](https://github.com/YACS-RCOS/university/blob/master/universities/nyu/proposal.md).

There is a lot of groundwork that we've been doing to make the platform more
robust, agnostic, and developer-friendly, and a lot more to be done. We will
keep you updated on this in the coming days and weeks.

That's all for now, but check back very soon for more details!

Best,

Richie
