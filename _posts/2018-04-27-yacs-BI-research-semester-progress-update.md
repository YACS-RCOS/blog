We are approaching the end of the semester and I've been trying to summarize my notes from the previous readings.
At the beginning of the semester I didn't really understand what sort of problem we were dealing with and I selected Bayes' Theorem as my first
topic because I had some experience with it in another class. However, as the research progressed, I realized that solely using Bayes' Theorem
might not be sufficient to create a recommendation system for the users. Then I started looking into other methods like machine learning and I've
learned more about collaborative filtering.

Some problems I discovered:

- Conducting research without identifying a specific problem to tackle is very inefficient

- It is hard to quantify the progress because most of the time I'm just reading more reference books instead of writing code

- We should have started with researching successful models from big companies since they have large set of data

Hopefully I can improve my working methods and contribute more in the next semester.
