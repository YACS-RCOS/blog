As the summer is just beginning I will continue my work on Yacs. My goal for the summer is to learn the workings of the backend so that I may have a better understanding of Yacs as a whole as well as the ability to strengthen the backend. To do this I will need to learn ruby and the inner workings of the database.

The tasks that I plan to work on include:
- Notice Bar API
- Search Algorithm Updates (Allow more substrings/acronyms)
- Update Feed

This list is subject to change as summer progresses and I learn more about Yacs. As usual I will post the important updates on this blog.
