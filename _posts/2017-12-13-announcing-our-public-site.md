Hello Everyone!! I'd like to announce our up-and-coming public site! The aim of this site is to provide information, promotion, and documentation for the YACS project. We hope to eventually use this to automatically onboard new schools!

Here is a mockup of what the site might look like:

We will begin development on this over the winter break, and hope to have it in a working state before next semester :)
