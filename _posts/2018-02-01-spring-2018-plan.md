# Description
----------

YACS, or Yet Another Course Scheduler, is a tool to help students create schedules and find courses. Its aim is to make planning a semester as painless as possible. YACS also aims to be easily portable and compatible with colleges other than RPI.

This semester is focused on getting our extended set of services ready for use and deployment, and connecting the components and architecture we have been building up over the last year. We will also be moving key pieces of our architecture over to Apache Kafka, which will serve as a central bus for messaging and data processing. We will also extend the functionality of the admin panel to act as a configuration tool for the data processing system.

We will have four team leads: Katie Burkhardt, who will oversee admin and frontend development, Yuze Ma, who will oversee data & analytics, Ryan Stillings, who will oversee development of the Planner service, and Richie Young, who will oversee the system architecture and some frontend development.

# Goals
----------
## YACS Architecture Goals

**Complete production version of streaming data pipeline**

  [ ] Use existing containerized source adapter model developed last semester
  [ ] Use Kafka to create a topic for each source
  [ ] Use Kafka Streams API to create a Java application (amalgamator service) to filter and combine source streams 
  [ ] Create topic to act as master stream of updates to be consumed by core Rails app
  [ ] Develop API for configuring and viewing the state of the amalgamator service to be used by admin frontend
  

**Integrate user system with core backend and frontend**

  [ ] Create common header component with login link
  [ ] Create common session service to handle redirects and session storage


## YACS Frontend & Admin Goals

**Completion of main interface**

  [ ] Replacing confirm dialog with modal
  [ ] Add parent params to URLS
  [ ] Implement proper mock data
  [ ] Form for period
  [ ] Test course model
  [ ] Update documentation

**Misc Frontend Enhancements**

  [ ] Loading animation
  [ ] Footer
  [ ] Consistent use of icons
  [ ] Consistent cursor
  [ ] Highlight active tab

**Replace scrolling with pagination**

  [ ] Research ngx-pagination or possibly another option
  [ ] Design mockups for pages
  [ ] Customize pagination CSS
  [ ] See if we can use pagination to load less data at once from YACS API

**Search/Filtering**

  [ ] Design search bar
  [ ] Add search params to URLs
  [ ] Implement search functionality
  [ ] Allow results to be filtered by dept, instructor, etc.

**Test/Build automation (stretch goal)**

  [ ] Setup a build to work with a local yacs instance
  [ ] Grunt/Gulp to automate prod, dev, test, staging, local builds
  [ ] Integrate with Docker
  [ ] Integrate with Travis
  [ ] Generate test coverage reports
  [ ] Integrate automation into repository

**Activity Logging (stretch goal)**
**Compare data in admin with data in malg (stretch goal)**


## YACS Data Analytics Goals

**Environment for data analysis**
This milestone focuses on setting up a nice environment for the data analysis. And ideally, this should be added into Orchestra.

[ ] Integrate with Orchestra
[x] Python3.6
[x] MongoDB

**Map out the data we have currently**
This is more of a research direction. We need to figure out what kind of data we have now and what we can expect first. After that, we should come up with a freamework that can perfectly divide datas into different part. One possible solution could be divide them by how they are generated: statically or dynamically.

[ ] Statics Data 
[ ] Dynamic Data

**Course Selection Alert system**
This is a feature that will automatically send mails to school advisors when a course is about to filled up.

[ ] Try to create a real-time banner grabber.
[ ] Implement a derivative function for calculting the speed when a course is under registeration.

**Research about recommendation algorithms from existing products.**
This is more of a research direction. We want to do course recommend for students by applying some baic discrete mathmatic concepts such as bayes theorem.

[ ] Amazon Recommend Algo
[ ] Implement bayes theorem
[ ] (Ideally) Students classificaiton


## YACS Expansion Goals
[ ] Create static site
[ ] Migrate hosting to Azure to be used by all schools
[ ] Move blog to static site
[ ] Make blog posts for every release
[ ] Create formal instructions for creating a data service
[ ] Compare schema to other schools
[ ] Work with students from NYU & MSU
# Team Contract
----------
## Projects

High level project management will be achieved using Github Projects. A project will exist for each sub-team, and should be consistently updated to track and manage the progress of each team.

## Issues

All pending and in-progress work will be tracked using Github issues. All contributions should correspond to a specific issue. Questions and comments regarding acceptance criteria and implementation details should be made as comments on the issue, as opposed to slack conversations or other communication channels.

## Contributing

Contributors will fork the project, and submit pull requests to the staging branch once an issue is complete and build checks have passed. All pull requests should have a passing build. Once the PR has been peer-reviewed the work will be merged into staging. Before being merged into master and deployed, the changes should be manually vetted in the staging environment. These instructions will be mirrored on the project README, which is the point-of-truth for this information.

## Meetings

The YACS team will meet once per week outside of the RCOS meeting times. All members are expected to attend regularly.

## Code of Conduct

All participants and community members must adhere to the RCOS Community Code of Conduct. Each participant must carefully read and verbally agree to the code of conduct.
