Having just joined YACS this semester, I have been working on getting up to speed with the rest of the team. I spent the first couple weeks setting up my linux environment and installing all the necessary software to set up YACS/Planner. I also learned the basics of git.
Once the development environment was working I began learning typescript and Angular 4. By working through the Angular 4 tutorial I gained an understanding of the general folder and file organization which is used for the frontend of this project. I now have a general knowledge of components, modules, routers, services and models which has helped me navigate the yacs-web folder. 
Originally my assignment was to the Planner team. Due to issues in running Planner locally, I have been moved to the yacs-web frontend. My assignment now is to create a notice bar which gives the user special notifications about planned down time or any other relevant information. The issue can be seen here: https://github.com/YACS-RCOS/yacs/issues/232. The focus of this project is to create a notice model that will be displayed through the interaction of the notice bar component and notice service. Currently I am using mock notices to develop. Eventually we will have notices pulled from the API.
 When I have a significant amount of work on this issue I will create another blog post to explain the specifics of my implementation and any problems Iâ€™ve had.
