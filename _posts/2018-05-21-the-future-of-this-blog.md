Hello everyone!

Some recent discussion amongst RCOS leadership about the role of blogging in our
organization has prompted me to reconsider the purpose of this blog. I have
actually been wanting to shift its focus for a while, and right now we are in a
good place to do that. This post will explain our new blogging scheme, and why
we will be making these changes.

First, a little bit of background. Until very recently, we have required that
every RCOS project have a blog, and that each member blog "regularly". The aim
of this requirement was to provide a track for projects to build a community,
encourage members to build written communication skills, and to provide us (the
coordinators, mentors and faculty) a way to engage with and monitor the progress
of the various projects.

Over time, however, we have been forced to recognize that the vast majority of
our membership view this required regular blogging as a chore, and use it at
more of an individualized status update than a platform for sharing meaningful
and useful information about their projects. In response to this, we are
shifting the role of blogging and written updated in our currciulum entirely.
The curriculum-level changes have not been finalized, so I'll explain exactly
how in a future update to this post.

In order to fit this new model, and with the aim of maximizing the utility of
this blog, we are going to be moving away from individual contributor status
updates, and instead only posting interesting and relevant project and technical
updates, more in line with the role of blogging in most open source projects.

More specifically, we are going to have regular, incremental blog posts covering:
- New releases
- New services
- Major/grouped feature additions
- Architectural changes
- Tutorials / reusable solutions

We hope that this new model will be more useful for our readers, and will
encourage engagement with the community. We are still not going to allow blog
comments, but feel free to [drop us a line](mailto:team@yacs.io)!

Until next time,

Ada
