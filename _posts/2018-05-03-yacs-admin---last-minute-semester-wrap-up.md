Excuse the cliche '80s teen movie quote, but in what feels like a blink of an eye YACS Admin is wrapping up its third semester.

It feels like just yesterday I was just starting off both mentorship and being on a large project, and to be honest I felt pretty lost. I thought being in RCOS for 3 semesters would help, but when you're thrown into a big project and it takes you weeks just to set up, it can be incredibly discouraging.

Thankfully I was lucky enough to join my former mentor as a co-mentor, and without that help I would have quit the project. And here I am at 1am the day after classes end, wrapping up my third semester, and my second semester as the admin panel project lead. 

This isn't going to be another long ramble about how school has gotten in the way of progress, because I've realized that I always set impossibly high standards for myself, and I've been learning to mitigate that.

Over these past three semesters, I've learned a lot about adaptability. From having an entire operating system be incompatible with Docker, to having an entire project break due to negligence, and having to refactor, and having to throw away milestones because of a stressful courseload, I honestly would have thrown in the towel had I not learned to adapt. 

Part of how I learned to adapt to change seems paradoxical --- knowing my rigid nature and resistance to change, not fighting against it. It is a strength at times, allowing me to make a plan and stick to it. But when I cannot stick to a plan, I seem to always be incredibly stressed out. Knowing that I will be stressed out in advanced has honestly helped me cope a lot with stress.

But what's helped me the most was the support of my teammates, my mentors, and everyone at RCOS. That being said, I can hardly believe I only have one more semester left at RPI. It's going to be incredibly hard to leave RCOS, but I see my final semester as an opportunity to strengthen the impact I have on the YACS team, and on RCOS as a whole. I am incredibly proud to say I will be taking on the role of a coordinator at RCOS next semester, and I cannot wait to give back to the community that has helped me grow so much over my time at RPI.
