It is the middle of the semester, which means things are getting _very_ busy. The week before spring break, the admin panel team just returned from a 2 week hiatus we had planned since the entire team had exams during the hiatus period. 

Due to the busy nature of this point in the semester, we haven't been working as quickly as we would have liked. Part of it is due to establishing a norm of working on issues in separate branches and reviewing PR's before merging. This may be decreasing the volume of the commits and progress, but it has been increasing the quality of the commits since things aren't hastily being merged into master. I've noticed that debugging has gone a lot more smoothly lately, especially since we are debugging on our own branches and not having multiple bugs affect the entire team.

However, we have been making significant progress and we are almost finished with the first milestone even though we took a rather long hiatus from the project. The project board has been working well to not only track what is being worked on and where we are with regards to progress, but it has been preventing miscommunication between team members. 

The bottom line of this blog post: number of commits aren't an end-all-be-all metric of team performance. It _can_ be concerning if very few commits have been made with zero explanation or team communication, but with clear team communication, quality can definitely be more important than quantity.
