Hi everyone, my name is Bryan Dieudonne, and I will be joining YACS this summer to work on multiple components of the YACS system. As of today, Iâ€™m learning Ruby/Rails,Kafka, and the codebase. I plan to work on the following parts of the YACS ecosystem:

- Realtime Notification System Backend (yacs)
- Event Analytics (TBD)

This list is subject to change & check out for my blog updates accordingly.
