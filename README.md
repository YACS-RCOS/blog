# YACS Blog

This is the repository powering the new YACS Blog, which you can find on [blog.yacs.io](https://blog.yacs.io).

### How to Post

The blog has been set up so that all you need to do is write a new Markdown file in the `_posts` folder and fill in some information about who is authoring the blog and the time it was written. Use the "post_template.md" file as a guideline.

**Important:** Your post must be named according to the [Jekyll blog post naming guidelines](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/posts/#creating-post-files). Otherwise it won't be seen as a post.

Then, just commit your new file and push it, and in a couple minutes it'll appear on the blog!

### Developer Info

The `_data/devs.yml` file contains a list of authors (as they are written in the headings of the post markdown files) and an associated *blogname* and *github*. The blogname is what your name will show up as in the headings of posts and the github is your personal Github account name.
